## Layer One Document for Mortgage App (US Market)

### Introduction

This document outlines the foundational layer design and security considerations for a mortgage application tailored for users in the United States. The app aims to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience for users interested in buying mortgages, ensuring clarity, ease of navigation, and robust security.

### Look and Feel of the App

**1. User Interface and Navigation**

- The app will feature a clean and simple design to enhance user experience.
- Navigation will be intuitive, with clear, prominent buttons such as ‘Previous’ and ‘Next’ to guide users through the mortgage application process step-by-step.
- All elements will be designed to be easily visible and accessible, minimizing clutter and confusion.

**2. Color Scheme**

- The primary color palette will include blues, white, and gray, creating a calm and trustworthy atmosphere.
- Alternatively, a black and white theme can be used for a minimalist, professional look.
- The colors will be chosen to ensure good contrast and readability across all devices.

**3. Additional Recommendations**

- Consider incorporating subtle animations or progress indicators to show users where they are in the application process.
- Use consistent typography and spacing to maintain a clean layout.
- Include tooltips or brief explanations for complex terms to assist users unfamiliar with mortgage jargon.
- Ensure the design is responsive and mobile-friendly, as many users will access the app via smartphones.


### Security Considerations

**1. Login Credentials**

- Users can log in using their phone number, email address, or a username, providing flexibility.
- The login process will be designed to be straightforward yet secure.

**2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- To enhance security, 2FA will be implemented.
- An example method is sending a one-time security code via SMS to the phone number linked to the user’s account.
- This extra step will verify that the login attempt is legitimate and protect against unauthorized access.

**3. Additional Security Recommendations**

- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS) throughout the app to protect data in transit.
- Store sensitive user data securely with encryption at rest.
- Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- Regularly update and patch the app to protect against emerging security vulnerabilities.
- Consider biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) as an optional login method for enhanced convenience and security on supported devices.

This foundational layer will ensure the mortgage app is both accessible and secure, providing users with confidence and ease throughout their mortgage buying journey. Further layers can build upon this base to add features and functionality as needed.
